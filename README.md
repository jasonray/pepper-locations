Will follow setup instructions for AWS RDS w/MariaDB https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_GettingStarted.CreatingConnecting.MariaDB.html

RDS Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home?region=us-east-1#databases
Subnet Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?region=us-east-1#subnets:sort=SubnetId

I will use Jetbrains Datagrip [https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/] for access to the database
